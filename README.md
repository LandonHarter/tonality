## What is Tonality?
Tonality is an online educational platform that allows students to take a deep dive into the world of classical music. The platform hosts interactive lessons and videos ranging from music theory to analyzing individual pieces.

## How did we build Tonality?
We used NextJS and Firebase as the core tools for the platform. NextJS allowed us to create a fast and responsive website that is easy to maintain and update. Firebase allowed us to create a secure and scalable backend that can be easily updated and maintained.
